This course uses DATA hosted in the SASHELP library. The downloaded files consist of 
the additional SAS code, formats, txt, xlsx and csv files needed throughout the course.


SAS Studio with SAS Analytics Pro is delivered via a container, so even though SAS Studio
might be installed on your laptop, the server is running in a contained environment. 
Once you have downloaded these files, follow these instructions to upload them to the 
server.

1. Open and Log in to SAS Studio.
2. Use the Explorer section in the navigation pane to navigate to a space that allows for          
   READ/WRITE access.
3. Create a folder called SSPG.
4. Click Upload files on the Explorer section toolbar to upload the files.
5. Click the plus sign in the Upload files popup box to add the files.
6. Navigate to the downloaded course files.
7. Select all the files.
8. Click Open and Upload. The data is now available for use during the course. 

PLEASE NOTE: The first demonstration illustrates uploading the cars.xlsx file to the server,
you have already uploaded the cars.xlsx file to the SSPG folder, as per instructions above.
